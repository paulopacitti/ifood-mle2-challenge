# iFood ML Engineer Test

The goal of the exercises below is to evaluate the candidate knowledge and problem solving expertise regarding the main development focuses for the iFood Generative AI Platform.


## Generative AI model serving

Part of the ML Engineer job is to ensure the models developed by the Data Scientists are correctly deployed to the production environment, and are accessible via a REST microservice.

And when we're talking about Generative AI models, the flow is a bit different from "classical" AI.

### Deliverables

There are two goals for this exercise. The first one is to create an automated Generative AI model fine-tuning process.

The second one is to create a Rest API documented with Swagger that serves predictions for a given fine-tuned Generative AI model.

This process/pipeline should be generic enough to use any base models, with any data.

Languages, frameworks, platforms are not a constraint, but your solution must be inside a docker image, docker compose, script or notebook ready to be run. Training a model or serving the Rest API/Swagger structure should be as simple as running a script or something similar. You should also provide a README file on how to execute the training job, and how to request the API or Swagger. There are a lot of tools that solve most of this problem; while you are free to use them, please try to balance the time you will save by using them with being able to show your programming skills by not using them as much.

## AWS infrastructure

The last skill a ML Engineer must have is cloud proficiency. For iFood, AWS is our cloud of choice.

For this exercise, we would like for you to propose an AWS architecture to serve a solution for one of the two previous exercises. A single page describing the resources needed is sufficient, although you are free to provide code if you like it. Please have in mind that this structure must be reliable, scalable and as cheap as possible without compromising the other two requisites.

## BONUS!!

These exercises are all optional! They are not required to evaluate how you'll perform in this job, and they require no skills listed in the job description whatsoever! They are fun and difficult, though ðŸ˜ˆ

Let's get to it!

### Level 1 and 2

Can you figure out the passwords for the binaries `bonus/level01` and `bonus/level02`?

### Level 3

Can you get a shell from the binary `bonus/level03`?

```
 Ex.
 $ ./bonus/level03
 [+] calling some crazy function, can you get a shell?
 password: something_that_executes_/bin/sh
 $ echo "Habemus shell!"
```
